📘 README – Assignment 4
Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python
📂 Overview
This assignment focuses on understanding how to work with files and handle exceptions and errors in Python. It consists of two main tasks:

Task 1: Reading from a file and handling file-related errors.

Task 2: Writing and appending data to a file, then displaying the final contents.

Each task emphasizes practical file handling operations and the importance of proper error management in real-world Python programs.

🔹 Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
✅ Problem Statement
You need to write a Python program that:

Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.

Prints its contents line by line.

Gracefully handles the situation if the file does not exist.

This task introduces file reading using Python's built-in functions and demonstrates how to prevent crashes when files are missing by using error handling techniques.

💡 Expected Output
If the file exists, the program will display each line of the file content.

If the file does not exist, the program will show an appropriate error message to the user without crashing.

🔹 Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
✅ Problem Statement
You need to write a Python program that:

Takes input from the user and writes it to a file named output.txt.

Appends additional data to the same file.

Reads and displays the final content of the file to the user.

This task demonstrates how to work with file writing and appending modes, and how to combine them with reading the final output.

💡 Expected Output
If the user inputs a value (e.g., 25), the file output.txt will contain:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
25
This is appended data.
And the displayed output will be:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
Final content of the file:
25
This is appended data.
▶️ How to Run the Programs
Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Save the script files with the correct names (task1_read_file.py and task2_write_append_file.py).

Run the scripts from your terminal or code editor:

Run Task 1 to test reading from sample.txt.

Run Task 2 to test writing and appending data to output.txt
